Get the latest exponentially-weighted moving average (EMA) price and confidence
interval for the requested price feed id.  The price feed id is a 32-byte id
written as a hexadecimal string; see the [price feed
ids](https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids) page to look up the id for
a given symbol.  The returned price and confidence are decimal numbers written
in the form \`a * 10^e\`, where \`e\` is an exponent included in the result.
For example, a price of 1234 with an exponent of -2 represents the number 12.34.
The result also includes a \`publishTime\` which is the unix timestamp for the
price update.  The EMA methodology is described in more detail in this [blog
post](https://pythnetwork.medium.com/whats-in-a-name-302a03e6c3e1).

The caller provides an \`age\` argument that specifies how old the price can be.
The call reverts with a \`StalePriceError\` if the on-chain price is from more
than \`age\` seconds in the past (with respect to the current on-chain
timestamp).  Call [updatePriceFeeds](updatePriceFeeds) to pull a fresh price
on-chain and solve this problem.

This function reverts with a \`PriceFeedNotFound\` error if the requested feed
id has never received a price update.  This error could either mean that the
provided price feed id is incorrect, or (more typically) that this is the first
attempted use of that feed on-chain. In the second case, calling
[updatePriceFeeds](updatePriceFeeds) will solve this problem.
